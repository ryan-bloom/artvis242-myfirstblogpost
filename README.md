### Art Piece 1

What stands out most to me when looking at Carla Gannis’s works is the vibrant color scheme that she uses.  Many of her works, including the Midnight Moment (depicted in the link below) and the Garden of Emoji Delights (image 1 below) don’t follow or stick to one specific color pattern or family, as many more traditional artists’ works often do.  Instead, Gannis utilizes virtually every color, which can be difficult to do well, but I personally like the way that Gannis does this as it immediately captured my attention.  In addition to her color schemes, the subjects of Gannis’s works, especially Garden of Emoji Delights, appeal to a relatively young audience as she incorporates elements of popular culture and the younger generation’s reliance on and fascination with technology into her works.  For example, Gannis uses emojis in her work Garden of Emoji Delights, which have only become popular and easily recognizable over the last decade or so due to the texting trends of the younger generation, in order to build and create larger imagery.  In the case of this work, she creates images of Eden, Hell, and Earth on three separate panels.  This piece was displayed at Kasia Kay Art Projects Gallary in 2014.  Gannis’s artwork is some of the most unique art that I have seen and I think that she does a great job of appealing to the new, young generation as well as utilizing new media in her work.
